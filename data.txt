Christopher Columbus
Italian-born navigator who founded fame when he landed in the Americans (October 12,1492)
Sat sail on behalf of Spain with three ships: the Nina, the Pinta, and his flagship, the Santa Maria
Originally, he had sailed west across the Atlantic Ocean to find a water route to Asia
Columbus was convinced that he had found the waterway that he sought and that the Americans were actually an extension of China
Returned from his expedition with gold, encouraging future exploration

Amerigo Vespucci
Italian member of a Portuguese expedition
Explored South American
Discovery suggested that the expedition had found a "New World"
After an account of Vespucci's 1497 expedition was published, a cartographer mistakenly thought that Vespucci had lad the expedition and had landed on the New World before Christopher Columbus; the cartographer named the continent America

Treaty of Tordesillas
Commitment between Spain and Portugal
Crated a papal line of Demarcation, which divided the New World: east of the line of it for Spain
Later, the Papal line affected colonization in Africa and Asia

New Spain
Spain's tightly controlled empire in the New World
To deal with labor shortages, the Spaniards developed a system of large manors (encomiendas) using Native American slaves under conquistadors
With the death of Native American slaves, Spaniards began importing African slaves to supply their labor needs

Mercantilism
Prevailing economic philosophy of the 1600s that held that colonies existed to serve the mother country
Founded on the belief that the world's wealth was sharply limited and, therefore, one nation's gain was another nation's loss
Each nation's goal was to export more than it imported in a favorable balance of trade; the difference would be made up in their possession of gold and silver, witch would make the nation strong both economically and militarily
Mercantilists believed economic activity should be regulated by the government

Queen Elizabeth I
Protestant successor to Queen Mary (England)
Popular leader and the first woman to successfully hold the throne
Invested in English raids on the Spanish New World
Brought on a war response from Spain in the form of the Spanish Armada
Established Protestantism in England and encouraged English business

The Spanish Armada
Fleet assembled by King Philip II of Spain to invade England
The Armada was defeated by the skill of British military leaders and by rough seas during the assault
England's victory over Spanish forces established England as an emerging sea power; it was one of the great achievements of Queen Elizabeth I
Defeat helped bring about the decline of the Spanish empire

Types of Colonies in the New World
In a charter colony, colonists were essentially members of a corporation and, based on an agreed-upon charter, electors among the colonists would control the government
A royal colony had a governor selected by England's king; he would serve in the leadership role and choose additional, lesser officers
Proprietary colonies were owned by an individual with direct responsibility to the king; the proprietor selected a governor, who served as the authority figure for the property

English Puritanism
Movement by those who wished to reform the Church of England to be more in line with their ideology
Puritans were Calvinist in their religious beliefs; they believed in predestination and in the authority of Scripture over papal authority
Though Kind Henry VIII had set out to separate from papal authority in favor of his own Church of England, many Roman Catholic traditions and practices remained
Puritans rejected these Roman Catholic holdovers because of their Calvinist ideology; they sought to make the England Church "pure"
Puritanism would echo throughout American culture in the ideas of self-reliance, moral fortitude, and an emphasis on intellectualism

Dutch West India Company
The joint-stock company that ran the colonies in Fort Orange and in New Amsterdam, which later became New York
Carried on a profitable fur trade with the Native American Iroquois
Instituted the patron system, in which large estates were given to wealth men who transported at lease fifty families to New Netherland to tend the land; few took on the opportunity

Sir Walter Raleigh
Selected Roanoke Island as a site for the first English settlement
Returned to England to secure additional supplies; on his return, he found the colony deserted; it is not known what became of the Roanoke settles
After the failure at Roanoke, Raleigh abandoned his attempts to colonize Virginia
Held back by a lack of financial resources and the war with Spain, English interest in American colonization was submerged for fifteen years

St. Augustine, Florida
French Protestants (Huguenots) went to the New World to freely practice their religion; they formed a colony near modern-day St. Augustine, Florida
Spain, which oversaw Florida, reacted violently to the Huguenots because they were trespassers and because they were viewed as heretics by the Catholic church
Spain sent a force to the settlement and massacred the fort's inhabitants
The settlement at St. Augustine, Florida, is considered to be the first permanent European settlement in what would become the United States

Charter Colonies (Joint-Stock) and "Starving Time"
Charter colonies were associations that sought trade, exploration, and colonization overseas
Jamestown (1607) was the first charter colony
"Starving Time" describes a period in the 1600s during which many colonists died and others considered returning to England

Jamestown
Named for James I (1566-1625), Queen Elizabeth's successor in England
James I granted charters for charter colonies in the New World
In 1607, the Virginia Company of London settled Jamestown, the first permanent English settlement, swampy location led to disease & contaminated water sources
Despite location and hostile relations with Native Americans, John Smith's harsh, charismatic leadership of the colony kept it from collapsing
In 1619, African slaves arrived at Jamestown, becoming the first group of slaves to reach a British settlement

Indenture System
Poor workers, convicted criminals, and debtors received immigration passage and fees in return for a number of years at labor on behalf of a planter or company
Servants entered into their contracts voluntarily and kept come legal rights
However, servants had little control over the conditions of their work and living arrangements; system led to harsh and brutal treatment

John Rolfe
English colonist in Jamestown, Virginia, married Pocahontas
Created process for curing tobacco, ensuring economic success for Jamestown

House of Burgesses
Representative assembly in Virginia
Election to a seat was limited to voting members of that charter colony, which at first was all free men; later rules required that a man own at least fifty acres of land to vote
First representative house in America
Instituted private ownership of land; maintained rights of colonists

First Families of Virginia
Wealth and socially prominent families in Virginia who by 1776 had been in America for four to five generations
Included the Lees, Carters, and Fitzhughs

Headright System
System used by the Virginia Company to attract colonists; it promised them parcels of land (roughly fifty acres) to emigrate to America
Also gave nearly fifty acres for each servant that a colonist brought, allowing the wealthy to obtain large tracts of land

The Separatists and Plymouth
Separatists were Puritans who believed the Church of England was beyond saving and felt that they must separate from it
One group of Separatists suffering government harassment fled to Holland, then to America
Members of this group traveled on the Mayflower; they became known as the Pilgrims, a term used for voyagers seeking to fulfill a religious mission
The Mayflower set sail from Plymouth, England, in September 1620 and landed in Provincetown Harbor, setting in what became Plymouth, Massachusetts
Before landing in the New World, the Pilgrims formed the Mayflower Compact, which provided for a government guided by the majority
William Bradford (1590-1657) served as the Plymouth Colony's first governor

Massachusetts Bay Company
Joint-stock company chartered by a group of Puritans escaping King James I
Led by John Winthrop, who taught that the new colony should be a model Christian society
These Puritans carefully organized their venture and, upon arriving in Massachusetts, did not undergo the "starving time" that had often plagued other first-year colonies
The government of Massachusetts developed to include a governor and a representative assembly

Delaware
Dutch patrons established the first settlement in Delaware
That settlement was destroyed by Native American attacks
The Dutch West India Company and Dutchmen, including Peter Minuit, began to trade and settle in Delaware during the mid-to-late 1630s
Between 1664 and 1674, Delaware switched between Dutch and English ownership, ending with English ownership in 1674

The Proprietors and Maryland
Proprietors owned colonies, with direct responsibility to the king
Proprietors were supposed to provide opportunity for Royal control and to decrease the practice of granting charters for charter colonies
In practice, proprietary colonies turned out much like the charter colonies because settlers insisted on self-government
In 1632, under George Calvert (Lord Baltimore), Maryland became the first proprietary colony as a refuge for English Catholics
To protect the catholic minority, Calvert's son encouraged religious toleration and established a representative assembly

Anne Hutchinson
Claimed to have special revelations from God that superseded the Bible, contrary to Puritan doctrine
The leadership of New England excused her of antinomian teachings; antinomianism is the belief that salvation is attained through faith and divine grace and not through strict adherence to rules or moral laws
Hutchinson was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony
With her followers, she founded Portsmouth in the Aquidneck region (1638); Aquidneck is now known as Rhode Island

Roger Williams and Rhode Island
Williams was a Puritan preacher who fled Massachusetts after his views on religious observance became too extreme for the colonists
Williams bought land from the Native Americans and founded Providence in 1636; it was soon populated by his many followers
Rhode Island formed as a combination of Providence, Portsmouth, and other settlements that had sprung up in the area
Through Roger Williams, the colony granted complete religious toleration
Tented to be populated by exiles and troublemakers and was sometimes called "Rogue's Island"
Suffered constant political turmoil

English Civil War
Conflict was based in the struggle between King Charles I (son of King James I) and the English Parliament
Charles claimed to rule by divine right; Parliament argued that its membership had rights that were separate from those granted to the king
Parliament's members were mostly Puritan and had the backing of the merchant class and lesser land owners
Wealthy nobles tended to support Charles I, who opposed Puritans on questions of religion
Led to outright conflict between Royalist military forces and forces opposing Charles I

Maryland Act of Toleration
Guaranteed religious freedom to all Christians in Maryland
Granted after Protestant became governor
Important precedent for later characterization of the United States and its Constitution

Connecticut
Thomas Hooker led a large group of Puritans to settle in the Connecticut River Valley; they had slight religious disagreements with the leadership of Massachusetts
The major colonies in the Connecticut River Valley agreed to unite as the Connecticut colony
In 1639, the colony formed a set of laws known as the Fundamental Orders; these laws provided for representative government by those who were permitted to vote
When the corporate colony was established and recognized by England, its charter was founded on the Fundament Orders
The Fundaments Orders are an important example of the growth of political democracy

The Carolinas
King Charles II rewarded loyal noblemen with these lands after the twenty-year Puritan revolution in England
In hopes of attracting settles, the proprietors planned for a hierarchical society
Experimented with silk manufacturing and with crops such as rice and indigo; this proved unworkable and the Carolinas grew slowly
Large groups of colonists in the Carolinas came from Barbados; the form of slavery that this group employed proved to be very harsh

New York and New Jersey
Last Dutch governor of New York was Peter Stuyvesant
After the British conquered the Dutch lands in America, English King Charles II gave the title to the lands to his brother, James, Duke of York
James was adamantly opposed to representative assemblies
Residents continued to call for self-government until James relented, only to break this promise when he became James II, King of England

Quakers
Quakers believed human religious institutions were, for the most part, unnecessary
They believed they could receive revelation directly from God and placed little importance on the Bible
They were pacifists and declined to show customary deference to their alleged social superiors
Their aggressiveness in denouncing established institutions brought them trouble in Both Britain and America
They opposed slavery and favored decent treatment of Native Americans
Elements of this culture would play a role in shaping the characterization of a United States that valued independence and social equality

William Penn
Founded Pennsylvania as a refuge for his fellow Quakers
Penn advertised his colony widely in Europe and offered generous terms on land
Guaranteed a representative assembly and full religious freedom
Settlers flocked to Pennsylvania from all over Europe

Black Slaves in the 1600s
Because slaves were only a small percentage of the population, they began at almost slaves the same level of indentured servants
Later in the century, African-Americans came to see as lifelong slaves whose status would be inherited by their children
Increased importation and population of African-Americans in the southern colonies began

John Locke and Natural Law
Locke was a major English political philosopher of the Enlightenment
Isaac Newton theorized Natural Law in the realm of science; Locke followed him, trying to identify Natural Law in the human realm
Natural Law included the rights of life, liberty, and property
Locke's assertion of Natural Law changed the perspective of the social contract theory; he believed that if the above rights were not protected, governments could be overthrown justly
Prior to Locke, their existed a theory of social contract--- people accept certain restrictions on themselves for the benefit of their society; these restrictions are upheld by a sovereign power
Locke's ideas became the indirect theory of American political activity for leaders such as Benjamin Franklin

Triangular Trade (Atlantic Trade)
European merchants purchased African slaves with goods manufactured in Europe or imported from Asian colonies
These merchants sold slaves in the Caribbean for commodities (sugar, cotton, tobacco)
Caribbean commodities were later sold in Europe and North America
Useful for all parties because it was an exchange of goods, not money

Navigation Acts
Certain goods shipped from a New World port were to go only to Britain or to another New World port
Enumerated goods from the colonies like sugar, cotton, tobacco, were to be provided only to England
Served as the foundation of England's worldwide commercial system
Though for the benefit of all subjects of the British Empire, its provisions benefited some New World colonies at the expense of others
Intended as a weapon in England's ongoing struggle against its rival, Holland
Led to increased tension between Britain and the colonies

Effects of the Navigation Acts
Boosted the prosperity of New Englanders, who engaged in large-scale shipbuilding
Hurt the residents of the Chesapeake by driving down the price of tobacco
Transferred wealth from America to Britain by increasing the prices Americans had to pay for British goods and lowering the prices Americans received for the goods they produced
Mercantilism also helped bring on a series of wars between England and Holland in the late 1600s

Bacon's Rebellion
Virginia's Royal governor, William Berkeley, received strict instructions to un the colony for the benefit of Britain
Nathaniel Bacon was a leader of colonial frontiersmen in Virginia
Bacon objected to the rights granted to Virginia's wealthy inner circle and was angered by Governor Berkeley's inability to protect Virginia from attacks by the Native Americans
Bacon commanded two unauthorized raids on Native American tribes, increasing his popularity; Berkeley had him arrested
Soon after, Bacon gathered his forces, opposed the Royal governor, and set fire to Jamestown to defend his forces; position
With British military, Berkeley ended the rebellion
After bacon's rebellion, American colonies turned increasingly away from indentured servants and toward slave labor

New Hampshire
King Charles established it as a Royal colony
The colony remained economically dependent on Massachusetts; Britain continued to appoint a single person to rule both colonies until 1741
Weeks before the signing of the Declaration of Independence by the Second Continental Congress, New Hampshire established a temporary constitution for itself that proclaimed its independence from Britain

Glorious Revolution
Internal British struggle that replaced the Catholic King James II with his Protestant daughter, Mary, and her husband, William of Orange
Inspired colonial uprisings in New York and Maryland against ruling Royal governors who pressed for more control
Led to the overthrow of the Dominion of New England, the control authority imposed by Britain of colonists
William and Mary's new government generally accepted these actions, permitting the growth of colonial institutions and culture

Half-Way Covenant
Decision by Puritan colony churches to allow the grandchildren of those who had the personal experience of conversion to participate in select church affairs
Previously, only the children of those who had experienced conversion could participate
Reflected the decline of piety New Englanders

Salem Witch Trials
Several young girls in Salem Village claimed to be tormented by the occult activities of certain neighbors
Some twenty persons were executed
Puritan ministers finally intervened to stop the executions
Writer Arthur Miller produced The Crucible (1953), a retelling of the Salem Witch Trials and a reflective commentary on the witch-hunts of Joseph McCarthy

Wool Act
All wool that was produced in the colonies could only be exported to Britain
Act restricted Ireland in its wool manufacturing, resulting in many Irish immigrants moving to the American colonies
The Act was meant to protect Britain's own exports of wool at the expense of both the colonies and Ireland

The Enlightenment
Connects to the idea of Deism, in which the universe was created by God and then abandoned; no supernatural controls would be exerted and all things were explainable by reason
Enlightenment philosophy dictated that human reason was adequate o solve mankind's problems and correspondingly, much less faith was needed in the central role of God as an active force in the universe
Idea moved from Europe to become the New World's seed of culture, intellectualism, and society
Some important Enlightenment writers include John Locke (Principia Mathematica, 1687), Isaac Newton (Essay Concerning Human Understanding, 1689), and Rene Descartes, whose basic tenet of philosophical theory existed in the phrase "I think, therefore, I am."

Georgia
James Oglethorpe, and English philanthropist and soldier, chartered the colony
Settlers included those who paid their own way to receive the best land grants
Some settlers were financed by the colony's board of trustees, including bands of prisoners from British jails
After wars between the European empires began, the colony served as a bugger between South Carolina and Spanish-held Florida
Elaborate and detailed regulations resulted in relatively little settlement

John Peter Zenger
German American newspaper publisher and printer
His acquittal of libel charges in New York City (1735) established a legal precedent for freedom of the press
The Supreme Court under Chief Justice Warren reinvigorated free press rights; the case of New York Times v. Sullivan(1964) strengthened the protection of the press against libel cases brought by public figures

The First Great Awakening
A series of emotional religious revivals occurring throughout the colonies and prevalent in New England
Preachers proclaimed a message of personal repentance and faith to avoid hell
Suggested an equality between and authority (God) and a fixed standard (the Bible)
Helped lay the foundation for a written "contract," which would be important to the establishment of the future United States Constitution
George Whitefield and Jonathan Edwards became the most dynamic preachers of the Great Awakening

Effects of the Great Awakening
American's religious community came to be divided between those who rejected the Great Awakening and those who accepted it
More denominations of Christianity were formed
While the Awakening created conflict among those who argued the points of religion, its ideas helped build connections between people living in different colonies
A number of colleges were founded by those who accepted the Great Awakening, including Princeton, Brown, and Rutgers

Jonathan Edwards
Preacher of the Great Wakening who emphasized personal religious experience, predestination, and dependence of man upon God and divine grace
One of his well-read sermons was "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God"
While Edwards is known for being one of the most prominent Calvinists, the Great Wakening was partially responsible for spreading the idea that salvation was possible without predestined election, and important Calvinist belief

Albany Plan
Delegates of seven colonies met in New York to discuss plans for collective defense
Pennsylvanian delegate, Benjamin Franklin, proposed a plan for an intercolonial government; the plan was later rejected by the colonial legislatures as demanding too great a surrender of power
While the other colonies showed no support for the idea, it was an important precedent for the concept of united in the face of a common enemy

French and Indian War
Rivalry between France, Britain, and various Native American tribes over land in the Ohio region
It was on of a series of wars fought between France and England throughout the world at the time
Battles continued on European and American fronts until Britain grained control of Canada
It was in these conflicts that George Washington first appeared as an able military leader

William Pitt

The Treaty of Paris of 1763 ended hostilities

Treaty of Paris, 1763
Ended Seven Years War
From France, Britain took Canada and some of what would become the United States east of the Mississippi River
France last all of its North American holdings
Spain took the Louisiana Territory
Treaty marked the end of salutary neglect, a relationship in which the British Parliament had somewhat ignored the colonies, allowing them to develop their character without interference

George Grenville
British Prime Minister who set out to solve the large national debt incurred in recent English wars

Proclamation of 1763
Was a result of Pontiac's Rebellion, a Native American uprising against the British for their mistreatment
Forbade white settlement west of the Appalachians to reduce friction between Native Americans and the settlers
Stated that Native Americans owned the land on which they wee residing
Outraged colonists believed that the successful outcome of the French and Indian War should have allowed settlement in the Ohio Valley

Strictly enforced, unlike the Molasses act of 1733
Taxed goods included imports such as wine, cloth, coffee, and silk

Quartering Act
Act that required the colonies in which British troops were stationed to provide soldiers with bedding and other basic needs
Colonists reacted negatively, fearing a standing army and disliking the additional costs
After the emergence of the United States Constitution, the Third Amendment protected citizens against the stationing of troops in their homes

Stamp Act
An internal tax, the sole purpose of which was to raise revenue
Required Americans to uses "stamped" paper for legal documents, newspapers, and playing cards, among other goods
Revenue from this tax was to be used solely for the support of the British soldiers protecting the colonies

Virtual Representation
English principle stating that the members of parliament represented all of Britain and the British Empire, even though members were only elected by a small number of constituents
This ides was meant to be a response to the colonial claim of "no taxation without representation," meaning that parliament was itself a representation of those being taxed

Boston Massacre
Occurred when the British attempted to enforce the Townshend Acts
British soldiers killed five Bostonians, including Crispus Attucks, and American patriot and former slave
John Adams provided the legal defense of the soldiers
Though the British soldiers acted more or less in self-defense, anti-Royal leaders used the massacre to spur action in the colonies

Tea Act and Boston Tea Party
Concessions allowed the British East India Company to ship tea directly to America and sell it at a bargain; cheap tea undercut the local merchants
Colonist opposed these shipments; they turned back ships, left shipments to rot, and held ships in port

The Intolerable Acts and the Coercive Acts
Name given by colonist to the Quebec Act (1774) and to a series of acts by the British in response to the Boston Tea Party
Acts closed the Port of Boston to all trade until citizens paid for the last tea
Acts increased the power of Massachusetts' Royal governor at the expense of the legislature
Allowed Royal officials accused of crimes in Massachusetts to be tried elsewhere

Methods of Colonial Resistance

The states that lacked western land claims feared that states with claims could grow in size, skewing representation in the federal government
Before signing the United States Constitution, these states demanded that those with claims cede the land
Ordinances in 1784 and 1785 and the Northwest Ordinance (1787) organized the ceded areas in preparation for statehood
New states were organized and admitted to the Union
This policy strengthened the ties of the western farmers to the central government

Treaty of Paris, 1783

Elastic Clause and the Tenth Amendment
The Tenth Amendment restricts the federal government to those powers delegated to it by the Constitution and gives all other powers to the states, or the people
Article I, Sect. 8 grants the federal government the power to make laws "which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers"
The conflict between these two ideas is the determination of which group, the federal government r the states and their people, has the right to exercise powers that have not been expressly delegated to the central government

The Constitution of the United States

The United States refused the bribe and suspended trade with the French
Led to the creation of the American Navy

Alien and Sedition Acts
Legislation enacted by the Federalists to reduce foreign influences and increase their power
New hurdles to citizenship were established
Broadened power to quiet print media critics
The legislation was used to silence Jeffersonian Republican critics of the Federalists and was indicative of the poisoned relations between the two parties
These Act tested the strength of the First Amendment and limited the freedom of the press
The Federalist Part gained a reputation as being a less democratic party, quickening its demise as a political organization

Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions
Response by Jeffersonian republicans to the Alien and Sedition Acts
Included text written by Jefferson and by Madison
Suggested that states should have the power within their territory to nullify federal law
Stated that federal government had no right to exercise powers not specifically delegated to it

Called into question the paradox of the Elastic Clause and the Tenth Amendment

The Napoleonic Wars
War between Napoleon's France and the other European powers, led by Britain
Both sides tried to prevent neutral powers, especially the United States, from trading with their enemy
American ships were seized by both sides and American sailors were "impressed," or forced, ino the British navy

Before becoming president, he served as the first Secretary of State
First president to reside in Washington, D.C.
Jefferson's taking of office was called the "Revolution of 1800" as it was the first time American changed presidential political leadership (Federalist to Jeffersonian Republican)

His administration was responsible for the Embargo of 1807
He presided over the Louisiana Purchase
His politics were characterized by support of states' rights

John Marshall

Marbury v. Madison
William Marbury had been commissioned justice of the peace in D.C. by President John Adams
His commission was part of Adams' "midnight appointments" during his last days in office
Marbury's commission was not delivered, so he sued President Jefferson's Secretary of States, James Madison
Chief Justice John Marshall held that while Marbury was entitled to the commission, the statute which allowed Marbury's remedy was unconstitutional, as it granted the Supreme Court powers beyond what the Constitution permitted
This decision paved the way for judicial review, which gave courts the power to declare statutes unconstitutional

Louisiana Purchase
Purchased for $15 million from France
Jefferson was concerned about the constitutionality of purchasing land without having this authority granted by the Constitution; to make the purchase, he employed the presidential power of treaty-making
United States' territory was doubled
The purchase helped remove France from the western borders of the United States
Farmers could now send their goods (furs, grains, tobacco) down the Mississippi River and through New Orleans, facilitation transportation to Europe
Opened land to agrarian expansion, helping fulfill one of the tenets of Jefferson's social ideology
The expansion westward created more states with Jeffersonian Republican representation to the point that the Federalists became a marginalized party

Burr Conspiracy
Burr planned to take Mexico from Spain and establish a new nation in the West
Burr, a fugitive in politics after Alexander Hamilton's death, was arrested in Natchez and tried fro treason
Under John Marshall, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Burr was acquitted
Marshall determined that the charge of treason required more than just proof of conspiracy to commit treason; this helped narrow the legal definition of treason

Embargo Act of 1807
American declaration to keep its own ships from leaving port for any foreign destination

Led the United states into the War of 1812 and concluded the war in 1814

Non-Intercourse Act
Congress opened trade to all nations except France and Britain
Trade boycott appeared to have little effect on curbing French and British aggression stemming from the Napoleonic Wars
Though the Embargo Act was a protective measure, the Non-Intercourse Act re-engaged the United States in trade while continuing its stance against alliances with either France or Britain
The Non-Intercourse Act was repealed in 1810

Fletcher v. Peck
Marshall Court decision
The first time state law was voided on the grounds that it violated a principle of the United States Constitution

Use of judicial review over state law made this a division of powers case

Dartmouth College v. Woodward
Marshall Court decision
Severely limited the power of state governments to control corporations, which were the emerging form of business
New Hampshire legislature tried to change Dartmouth from a private to a public institution by having its charter revoked
The Court ruled that the charter issued during colonial days still constituted a contract and could not be arbitrarily changed without the consent of both parties
Reaffirmed the sanctity of contracts

Adams-Onis Treaty
Helped define the United States-Mexico border
The border that was under Spanish control had created conflict between the two countries
Spain sold its remaining Florida territory to the United States and drew the boundary of Mexico to the Pacific
United States ceded its claims to Texas, and Spain kept California and the New Mexico region
United States assumed $5 million in debts owed by Spain to American
Later, lands kept by Spain would become battlegrounds for American expansion

Henry Clay's solution to deadlock over the issue of the acceptance of the proposed new state, Missouri
At the time, the Senate was evenly divided between slave and free states
A slave state of Missouri would tip the balance of power
John Tallmadge added an antislavery amendment meant to prohibit the growth of slavery into Missouri and to free slaves already in Missouri when they had reached a certain age
The Tallmadge Amendment caused the Senate to block the Missouri Compromise; it sparked heated debate about the future of slavery
To settle the dispute, northern Massachusetts became a new state (Maine)
The legislative section prohibiting slavery in Missouri was replaced by a clause stating that all land of the Louisiana Purchase north of thirty-six-thirty north latitude would prohibit slavery

Denmark Vesey
As a slave, he won enough money in a lottery to buy his own freedom

Four presidential candidatesâ€”Henry Clay (Speaker of the House), John Quincy Adams (Secretary of State), Andrew Jackson (1812 war hero), and William Crawford (Secretary of the Treasury)
 Jackson won the popular vote but did not win the majority of the electoral vote; as a result, the election went to the House of Representatives
Henry Clay, in the House of Representatives vote, threw his support to John Quincy Adams
In exchange for Adams winning the presidency over Jackson, Adams gave Clay the post of Secretary of State
Accusations of a "corrupt bargain" were made by Jackson, but are considered to be largely untrue

John Quincy Adams
Sixth President

Relied on the party system, emphasized states' rights
Politics came to rely on emotional appeals, with meetings in mass conventions to nominate national candidates for office

Spoils System
Andrew Jackson's method of exchanging government officials with new civil servants
"Rotation in office" was supposed to democratize government and lead to reform by allowing common folk to run the government
This system had been in place long before Jackson, but his name is tied to it because he endorsed its usage
In general, officials were replaced by those loyal to the new administration; the were not always the most qualified for the positions
Over the span of several presidential terms, the system led to corruption and inefficiency; it was ended with the passage of the Pendleton Act

Alexis de Tocqueville
French civil servant who traveled to and wrote about the United States
Wrote Democracy in America, reflecting his interest in the American democratic process

Eventually, formed the community near Great Salt Lake under Brigham Young
Settlement became the State of Utah

Webster-Hayne Debate
Debate in the Senate between Daniel Webster (MA) and Robert Hayne (SC) that focused on sectionalism and nullification
Came after the "Tariff of Abominations" incident

Influential among local slaves as a preacher
Believed it was his destiny to lead slaves to freedom
Led approximately sixty in revolt, killing the family of his owner and running rampant through the nearby neighborhood, killing fifty-five whites
The revolt was put down and Turner, some of his conspirators, and several free blacks were executed
Led to stricter slave laws in the South and an end to the Southern organizations advocating abolition

Tariff of 1832 and the Order of Nullification
The tariff favored Northern interests at the expense of Southern ones
Calhoun led a state convention calling for the Order of Nullification, which declared the tariff laws void; South Carolina would resist by force any attempt to collect the tariffs
Jackson, though a supporter of states' rights, defended the Union above all, and asked Congress to issue a new bill to give him authority to collect tariffs by force
Jackson encouraged his allies to prepare a compromise bill so that the federal government would not lose its image of control and so that South Carolina could back down from nullification
Henry Clay presented this Compromise Tariff of 1833 and South Carolina withdrew the Order, but tensions between the federal government and state governments grew

Nicholas Biddle, chairman of the Bank, worked with Clay to re-charter the Bank four years earlier than it was due
Jackson vetoed the measure, increasing his popularity

Texas, Leading to the Battle of the Alamo
Mexico refused to sell Texas to the United States, which had given up its claims to Texas in the Adams-Onis treaty
Texas had been a state in the Republic of Mexico since 1822, following a revolution against Spain
Mexico offered land grants for immigration to this area; many Americans responded and came to Texas, increasing population and revenue
Southerners moved to Mexico with interest in becoming slave masters; the presence of slavery angered the Mexican government
When the population changed, Mexico's power began to erode
Stephen Austin worked to first make Texas a Mexican state and later independent of Mexico

Battle of the Alamo
During Texas's revolution against Mexico, Ft. Alamo was attacked by the Mexican Army and 187 members of the Texas garrison were killed
Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, a Mexican military and political leader, was victorious

Trail of Tears
Worcester v. Georgia was a response to Jackson's Indian Removal Act
Cherokees in Georgia claimed to be a sovereign political entity
Native Americans were supported by the Supreme Court; Andrew Jackson refused to enforce the court's decision
By this point, Cherokees had largely met the government's demands to assimilate into Western-style democratic institutions
Still, Cherokees were forced to give up lands to the east of the Mississippi and travel to an area in present-day Oklahoma
The migration's effects were devastating as hunger, disease, and exhaustion killed about 4,000 Cherokee

Entered politics through the Liberty Party, calling for non-expansion of slavery into new western territories
Liberty Party would combine with the larger Free Soil Party membership

William Lloyd Garrison
His newspaper, The Liberator, espoused his views that slaves should be immediately emancipated
Many other anti-slavery advocates of the 1830's and 1840's recommends a gradualist approach

Population Growth and Change, Early 1800s
Labor shortage meant more opportunity for work
Influx of immigration included German skilled labor and Irish Catholics, who faced discrimination
Growth of population in the West and in rural areas
Urbanization outgrew public services, leading to inadequate security and clean water for city-livers
Race riots, religious riots, and street crime became part of city society

Women in the Early 1800s
Women participated in limited political activity that was mostly religious and reform in nature, such as abolition
Employment was limited mostly to school-teaching
Still lived in a "cult of domesticity," in which a woman's role in marriage was to maintain the home for her husband and to raise the children

Created more cooperation between the United States and Britain in curbing the slave trade

Irish and German immigration
1840s saw dramatic increases in Irish immigration due to potato famine in Ireland 
Poverty of the Irish immigration caused settlement in eastern cities and competition for jobs
1850s had increases in German immigration due to the failed revolution in 1848
Many Germans settled in Wisconsin because they had money and other resources; helped to cultivate the upper-Midwest portion of the united states
The five points neighborhood of New York City included Irish immigrants, African-American, and Anglo, Italian, and Jewish cultures; it encapsulated the melting-pot phenomenon in the United States

Manifest Destiny
Belief that American was destined to ex[and to the Pacific, and possibly into Canada and Mexico
John O'Sullivan, an American journalist, wrote an article pushing for the annexation of Texas and coined the phrase "Manifest Destiny"
Came out of post-1812 War nationalism, reform impulse of the 1830s, and the need for new resources
Those Whigs who supported Manifest Destiny favored more peaceful means; other Whigs fared American expansion, concerned about raising the slavery issue in new territories
Manifest Destin was an engine of both discovery and destruction; while American pushed westward, the ideas behind Manifest Destiny fueled the Mexican War and the displacement of Native Americans

Transportation in the 1840s and 1850s
Tremendous expansion of railroad lines, creating a national market for goods
Railroads linked the Midwest and the Northeast
Steamboats and clipper ships became more popular for travel

Four social classes in the South
Yeoman-Largest group; worked land independently, sometimes along with slaves, to produce their own food, like corn
Planters-Owned large farms and groups of slaves; exercised political and economic control with cotton exports
Poor Whites-Lived in squalor, often worse then the slaves
Slaves-worked land; three-fourths of whites in the south did not own slaves

Slave labor system-three categories
On large farms, white overseers directed clack drivers, who supervised groups in the fields as they performed gang labor
On smaller farms, a slave was assigned specific tasks, then given the remainder oh the day to himself
House servants were spared physical labor, but they enjoyed less privacy and had direct responsibility to the master

Slaves in Southern Urban areas
Slaves served as factory workers or in construction
Some purchased their freedom with their savings or disappeared into society 
As sectional troubles rose, fewer slaves were able to buy freedom or work in urban areas

Elements of slavery
Slaves suffered varying degrees of repression, although most received adequate housing and diet
Slaves did commit some violent uprisings
Many slaves tried to run away into bordering free states
Injustice created quiet revolt as slaves sabotaged their facilities, found ways to become unproductive for their masters, and ridiculed their woners
Despite their repression, slaves created their own common culture

Southern Response to slavery
Defense of slavery shifted from an early view (1970) that slavery as a "necessary evil" to being a "positive good" (after 1840)
Used scientific arguments, biblical texts, and historical examples to justify slavery
Both this defensive position and abolitionist sentiment increased 
Some Southerners, like George Fitzhugh, a Virginia lawyer, defended slavery by condemning Northern "wage slavery"; he used the idea of African-American inferiority to suggest that whites were protection slaves from a world of fierce competition in which, on their own, they would not survive

The underground railroad and Harriet Tubman
Method used to move slaves to free territory in the united states and Canada
Harriet Tubman was a slave smuggler and "conductor" if the Underground railroad.

Evolution of the Major Political Parties from Civil War to Modern Day
Key Moment: Passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act 
Political Parties: Republican and Democrat - extension of slavery into the territories was the main concern of Lincoln's Republican, while Democratic voting split North- South along the issue 
Evolutionary Point: After a Northern victory in the Civil War, the South became anti- Republican and anti- North,; the North maintained political control became increasingly industrial and wealthy
Key Moment: Though Democratic candidates had been elected since the Civil War, Franklin Roosevelt's presidency helped to redefine the party 
Parties: Modern- day Republican and Democratic parties- business and tariffs used to support the state versus policies that support broad social programs
